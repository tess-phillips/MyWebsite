At University I was on the committee for the UoM Feminist Collective where I learnt great deals from lots of great friends and speakers. I hope to eventually be able to join my passions for equality, anti-racism and feminism with my passions for tech, by working for companies that help the people on this planet, and the planet itself.</h3>

My family is Jewish and changed our surname in an effort to assimilate into British culture. I have recently been considering changing my surname back to it's original name to honour my history and ancestors, as although I am not fully observant, my Jewish identity is very important to me.</h3>

I've found it very interesting to discover the different powers of the different languages I've worked with, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and at one point stumbling on some jQuery too. I've found it particularly interesting to compare between python and javaScript looking at their similarities but with a very necessary distinction in their syntax.</h3>
